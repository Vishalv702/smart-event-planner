# 🌤️ Smart Event Planner - Backend

A backend system designed to help users plan outdoor events intelligently by considering weather forecasts and event requirements. It integrates with OpenWeatherMap to assess weather suitability and recommend better dates.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Core Functionality

- 🌦️ **Weather API Integration**  
  Uses OpenWeatherMap API for current and 5-day forecast data. Implements caching to reduce unnecessary API calls.

- 📅 **Event Management**  
  Create, update, view, and delete events (cricket, weddings, hiking, etc.) with location and date.

- 📊 **Suitability Scoring System**  
  Weather suitability is calculated based on event type (e.g., precipitation, temperature, wind).

- 📆 **Alternative Recommendations**  
  If weather is poor, suggests better dates within a 5-day range.

- 🔁 **Caching**  
  Weather responses are cached for 1 hour to minimize API usage.

- ⚠️ **Error Handling**  
  Handles invalid inputs, missing events, and external API failures.

- 💾 **MongoDB Integration**  
  All events and weather data are stored using Mongoose and MongoDB Atlas.
